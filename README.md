Using ```sklearn```, ```nltk```, ```spacy```, the Bag of Words Approach and Linear  Support Vector Machine (SVM) Models, a classification analysis is conducted on Architectural, Engineering and Construction vernacular. The training allows the model to learn phrases in relation to the six design stages within the industry. The Category class tests and trains on the 'Design Development' and 'Construction Review' processes via natural language.
